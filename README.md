In this miniproject i followed the publication : Home Energy Management System in an Algarve Residence. First Results by A. Ruano , K. Bot , and M. Gra√ßa Ruano and used the dataset to
forecast the electricity usage for a residential house in the Algarve. Making use of Occupation and Electricity consumption, sampled every 15 minutes, 
and daily occupation, you should forecast the house consumption for 12 hours in advance, is., 48 steps-ahead.

I have used MLP and SVR Artificial neural network models to predict and after that i have tuned the hyperparameters to improve the statistical errors.
